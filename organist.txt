Jane was born and raised in Stanly County to Christian parents who loved music. Her dad sang with the 600 member choir at the Billy Graham Crusade in Charlotte in the late 50’s and this inspired her with a love for hymns and church music. To serve the Lord with gladness and praise Him with music is Jane’s desire.
